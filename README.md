# Exercise-02a-Weapons
Exercise for MSCH-C220, 7 September 2021

A demonstration of this exercise is available at [https://youtu.be/PnflBjoclOs](https://youtu.be/PnflBjoclOs)

This exercise is the first opportunity for you to get your feet wet with Godot. It will explore the first step to creating an Arcade Space Shooter: firing weapons. In space shooter games, weapons can have many different attributes or characteristics, but we will be spawning one of the most basic types: an accelerating rocket.

First, be sure you have downloaded and installed the appropriate version of [Godot 3.3.3](https://godotengine.org/download) for your computer. Most likely, you will want the 64-bit version (only install the 32-bit version if the 64-bit doesn't run).

Godot is currently not code-signed on the Mac, so if you are running it on a Mac, the first time you run it, you will need to right-click on the application and Open (and then indicate that you want to open it). Subsequently, it should open normally.

Fork this repository. When that process has completed, make sure that the top of the repository reads [your username]/Exercise-02a-Weapons. Edit the LICENSE and replace BL-MSCH-C220-F21 with your full name. Commit your changes.

Press the green "Code" button and select "Open in GitHub Desktop". Allow the browser to open (or install) GitHub Desktop. Once GitHub Desktop has loaded, you should see a window labeled "Clone a Repository" asking you for a Local Path on your computer where the project should be copied. Choose a location where you will keep the repositories for this class. Make sure the Local Path ends with "Exercise-02a-Weapons" and then press the "Clone" button. GitHub Desktop will now download a copy of the repository to the location you indicated.

Open Godot. In the Project Manager, tap the "Import" button. Tap "Browse" and navigate to the repository folder. Select the project.godot file and tap "Open".

You should now see a main "Game" scene (res://Game.tscn), with a ship in the middle of the viewport. Run the game to see what has been provided.

Your task is to create a Weapon scene (saved as res://Weapon.tscn) that represents a rocket sprite that accelerates off the screen. The Project comes with a rotating ship that will be responsible for instancing the Weapon, positioning and rotating it.

The ship rotates with the A and D keys, and will fire using the space bar. 

Create a new 2D scene. Rename the Node2D "Weapon". Add res://Assets/rocket.png as a Sprite; make sure it is at position 0,0.

Right click on Weapon, Attach Script. In the script add a _physics_process function and make the node accelerate upwards over time.

(This is a possible example: 
```
extends Node2D

var speed = 0.5
var velocity = Vector2.ZERO

func _physics_process(_delta):
	velocity.y -= speed
	position += velocity.rotated(rotation)
```	
).

In Player.gd, you will need to uncomment (remove the # on) line 8. Run the main scene (Game.tscn). If you have done everything correctly, the ship should now fire a missile.

We will, of course, need to deal with collisions, explosions, damage, and other weapon types later. If the ship is able to fire missiles when the player hits the space bar, you have completed the exercise.

In GitHub Desktop, you should now see several files highlighted (including a new Weapon.tscn and Weapon.gd). Add a Summary message at the bottom of that panel (something like "Creates Weapon scene and allows ship to instance the scene."), and push the "Commit to master" button. On the right side of the top, black panel, you should see a button labeled "Push origin". Press that now.

If you return to and refresh your GitHub repository page, you should now see that your files have been changed (with a new date).

Now edit the README.md file. When you have finished editing, commit your changes, and then turn in the URL of the main repository page (https://github.com/[username]/Exercise-02a-Weapons) on Canvas.

The final state of the file should be as follows (replacing my information with yours):
